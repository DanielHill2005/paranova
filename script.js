I am constantly moving erratically to avoid being hit but some of the time I'm not fast enough to dodge the hits. My armor starts to fully diminish, to the point where it is fully coming off of my body in scraps. All my strikes with the lightning aren't doing as much damage as I had hoped and I am quickly running out of time to get the artifact and leave. I see a final chance with the lightning by bringing the largest lightning bolt I've ever produced. So I point my sword to the sky and before I could send it to the main golem, I am struck by the golem with enough force that the sword falls out of my hand. The main golem catches it and points it at me, pushing it through my chest. Before I know it the largest lightning bolt I've ever seen strikes me. Once the lightning goes away I can't even speak. I just simply look at the main golem and nod out of respect for the fight. The golem nods back and simply says "Good fight, and goodbye."`,

Somehow all that noise isn't enough to cover up the sound of the monster breathing. I can literally see its slow breath heaving up and down.

There was heavy mist in the air from the crashing waves and whatever else.I stepped out onto the deck and felt the cool mist. I thought it was refreshing until I realized it's probably more of that beast's saliva than anything else. I bellowed the words, "PRAECIPIO TIBI, UT NE DESINAS!"Somehow it heard me because suddenly the loud creaking from before turned into a light buzz as the raging whirlpool changed into a smooth tunnel. Apparently the monster can keep the water rotating at such a slow pace it almost looks frozen, all while the structural integrity of the tunnel remains intact.

        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This box must be the ship's AI. I'm screwed. I raise my blunt force maximizers to stop the AI before it can retaliate but it yells. "NO NO NO WAIT. I'm not hostile. Hold on!"
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fine, I'll give you a chance, but you have to give me whatever is in that canister," I say pointing to it, "And tell me what is going on with this planet!"
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay maybe I will, but first I need to tell you the full story," it says. It talks using thousands of little chirps that end up sounding like human speech somehow. "I am ZÃ¤ki, I was one of the akias species. I am the one that this demeaning âtomb' was made for. More like prison. They turned me into AI and locked me in this box to punish me. You see, we akias have evolved past dying, I was killed."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold on, Hold on, you're getting ahead of yourself. Start at the beginning. Why did the akias people come to this planet?"
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, we have always been more advanced than your race in most ways, except one. You have always been much better at AI. A computer can imitate a human mind much easier than it can do with an akias. So we decided that we would study how humans can make such good AI. We chose a good planet that was civilized but still primitive enough to be easily manipulated. That was Vortex. When we arrived it didn't take long for the humans to worship us as gods."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you keep talking trash about humans I'm gonna smash you to bits."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you would just listen you would know that I'm sympathetic towards humans. The akias tricked the humans into giving themselves up for study through a sacrificial ritual. Soon we were able to create our own version of AI, but it was different than how you humans do it. While we couldn't create AI from scratch advanced enough to be useful, we did figure out how to transfer consciousness into AI. They started trapping human minds inside boxes like these as AI. This is when I started to have issues with how we were treating humans. Everyone else saw humans the same way you see a dairy cow, but I couldn't look past the fact that your species had an intelligent life that we were taking advantage of. I tried to stop it, but it was just one of me versus all of them. They caught me and stopped me. But they have a cruel sense of humor so instead of just killing me they trapped me with the same fate I tried so hard to stop. Then they locked me down here. I can feel my energy source barely giving me enough energy to keep me alive but I'd need a lot of energy to break through the barrier and actually access it."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow. That's a lotâ¦ I can end it for you. I think the artifact that I'm looking for is your energy source."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. I can physically open it, but I will warn you. The limitations that my own kind have put on me mean that I can't calm it, and as soon as I lose my power source I die. If I'm being honest, I could have ended it all a long time ago, but I have been too scared. But I'll do it for you. 3.. 2.. 1.."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, calm it??"
